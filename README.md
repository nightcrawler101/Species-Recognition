# Species-Recognition
Project undertaken in my summer internship working under Azure Skynet Solutions Pvt. Ltd. 
I have used YOLO machine learning model which was trained on COCO dataset to classify species with a confidence box wrapped around the species stating how sure the ML model is about its classification. The surity of the ML model varies between 0 and 1 with value closer to 1 is directly proportional to surity of the model about recognition of the specie.
